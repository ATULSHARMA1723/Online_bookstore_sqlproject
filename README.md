# Online_bookstore_sqlproject

# Description:
This project involved designing and querying a relational database for an Online Bookstore using PostgreSQL. The goal was to simulate real-world book sales, customer management, and order tracking through structured data handling and SQL queries.

# The database schema includes three main tables:
Books – Contains book details like title, author, genre, publication year, price, and stock.
Customers – Holds customer data such as name, email, phone number, city, and country.
Orders – Captures purchase information including customer ID, book ID, order date, quantity, and total amount.

# The project utilized various SQL techniques such as:
Table creation and data import from CSV files
Basic queries for filtering, sorting, and retrieving information (e.g., books by genre, customers by country)
Aggregate functions for calculating totals, averages, and revenue
Joins to combine data from multiple tables
# Advanced queries like:
Top-selling genres and author
Most expensive books
Frequent customers
Cities with high-spending users
Remaining stock after sales
# Purpose:
To demonstrate the ability to design a normalized database structure, manage datasets, and draw actionable insights through SQL queries in a retail/bookstore environment.

# Tools Used:
PostgreSQL (SQL)
CSV data files (Books, Customers, Orders)
pgAdmin/SQL IDE (assumed)

# Key Insights Achieved:
Revenue generated from all orders
Most frequently ordered book
Remaining inventory after sales
Top 3 most expensive fantasy books
Cities and customers with highest spending
Total books sold by genre and author

# Outcome:
The project enabled detailed business insights such as total revenue, most sold genres/authors, customer purchase behavior, and inventory status. It showcases real-time business analytics skills using relational databases.
